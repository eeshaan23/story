once a shepherd boy lived in a village that stood in the feet of a hill.
He took his flock every day for grazing. the sheep kept grazing but the boy felt bored.
 one day he thought  of having some fun at the cost off his fellow villagers.
 he stood on ahigh rock and shouted at the top of his voice, "Wolf! Wolf! come to save me and my sheep."
 the villagers heard the cry and ran to help him. 
 when they reached the boy laughed at them saying, "No wolf, i did this only for fun"
